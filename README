======== This is my branch for hacking on terminator lib ========
=================================================================

Nothing here is supposed to used live. It may be unstable, unsecure,
break your pc into peaces and kill your first born.

Use the master branch for stable plugins.

This said: I try to enhance plugin possibilities here. Most of the code
is good and I will try to get some commits into terminator's official trunk.

If you see usefull aspects of here and want to contribute, please
contact me (or just do and send a pull request).
